            In this article, we would like to recap the first few months of running the
            open source project <a href="https://github.com/bhojpur/wealth/">Bhojpur Wealth</a>, a
            web-based wealth management software.

          <h2 class="h4">From 1* to 100 stars on GitHub</h2>
          <p>
            When I decided to
            <a [routerLink]="['/en', 'blog', '2018', '03', 'hello-bhojpur']"
              >publish</a
            >
            the project as
            <a href="https://github.com/bhojpur/wealth"
              >open source software</a
            >
            (OSS), we did not know what exactly to expect. In the worst case,
            nobody would care. And in the best case, the repository would be
            overrun with contributions. The truth is probably somewhere in
            between.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the beginning, it felt quite weird to develop in public where
            anyone can observe the progress. Stupid mistakes remain visible
            forever. But this feeling, fortunately, quickly settled. We believe
            the benefits like all the learning clearly outweigh the drawbacks
            when you just do it.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of 2018, Bhojpur Wealth reached an important milestone:
            <a href="https://twitter.com/bhojpurconsult/status/1470075774640218121"
              >100 stars</a
            >
            on GitHub. This is really exciting with almost no marketing. We are a
            technical founder, so we prefer writing code over anything else. But
            there is so much more to make this project happen: writing
            documentation, maintaining bug reports and feature requests,
            supporting users and managing the community, keeping the SaaS
            running, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reaching 100 stars will not only attract very early adopters, but
            also the early adopters. At the same time, the demands and
            expectations are also increasing.

          <h2 class="h4">What is new?</h2>
          <p>
            During the last months, the Bhojpur Wealth has transformed from a one man
            project into a prospering wealth management application with 9
            contributors and counting. User feedback has directly shaped the
            direction of the product development.
          </p>
          <p>These are some selected key features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Simplified self-hosting with an
              <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bhojpur/wealth"
                >official Bhojpur Wealth docker image</a
              >
              on Docker Hub
            </li>
            <li>Improved import for activities (transactions and dividend)</li>
            <li>Enriched market data for ETFs (region and industries)</li>

          <h2 class="h4">What is coming?</h2>
          <p>Here is a brief overview of what we are planning.</p>
          <p>
            The goal remains to offer a simple and solid software to manage
            finances. Thus, the main focus is on the core functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to reach break-even with the SaaS offering (<a
              [routerLink]="['/pricing']"
              >Bhojpur Wealth Premium</a
            >) and regularly report about the progress and my learnings on this
            exciting journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have already started to build a
            <a
              href="https://join.slack.com/t/bhojpur/shared_invite/zt-1bznh159x-ZR8xf2N_DhG6vkAhyjQKUA"
              >community</a
            >
            of users. In the future, I would like to involve more contributors
            to further extend the functionality of the Bhojpur Wealth (e.g. with new
            reports). Get in touch with us by sending email at
            <a href="mailto:support@bhojpur-consulting.com">support@bhojpur-consulting.com</a> or on Twitter
            <a href="https://twitter.com/bhojpurconsult">@bhojpurconsult</a> if you
            are interested, we are happy to discuss ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            We would like to say thank you for all your feedback and support
            during the last months.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have a great start into the new year and happy investing<br />
